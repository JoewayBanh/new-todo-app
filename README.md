# How to use todo app:

- After cloning the app from github you will have to type "npm i" in your terminal inside the repo to fetch all necessary dependencies. This will not take a long time.
- When the dependencies have been installed the app can be run with "npm start".
- As soon as the app loads you will see three inputs for text and a dropdown to choose the respective todo's priority.
- After all three inputs have been filled and priority has been chosen you can either press "enter" on your keyboard or click with your mouse on the button with the plus-icon.
- This will add your todo to the app.
- A filter feature can also be seen right beneath the plus-icon. This filter can be changed to either show all of your todos, all you have checked off, or all of them you have yet to finish.

- The rendered todo has four buttons:
  - Add subtask (still working on it).
  - Edit main title of todo.
  - Check off the todo.
  - Remove todo from the app.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
